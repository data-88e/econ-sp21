    "The table contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `yrsed`: Years of Education Completed$^1$\n",
    "- `female`: Binary variable (1 = female, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `black`: Binary variable (1 = black, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `hispanic`: Binary variable (1 = Hispanic, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `bytest`: Basic year composite test score. These are achievement tests given to high school seniors.\n",
    "- `dadcoll`: Binary variable (1 = father is a college graduate, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `momcoll`: Binary variable (1 = mother is a college graduate, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `incomehi`: Binary variable (1 = family income > \\$25,000 per year, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `ownhome`: Binary variable (1 = family owns their home, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `urban`: Binary variable (1 = high school in urban area, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- `cue80`: County unemployment rate in 1980 (%)\n",
    "- `stwmfg80`: Average state hourly wage in manufacturing in 1980\n",
    "- `dist`: Distance from 4-year college (in 10s of miles)\n",
    "- `tuition`: Average state 4 year college tuition (in 1000s of dollars)\n",
    "\n",
    "$^1$: Rouse computed years of education by assigning 12 years to all members of the senior class. Each additional year of secondary education counted as a one year. Studentâ€™s with vocational degrees were assigned 13 years, AA degrees were assigned 14 years, BA degrees were assigned 16 years, those with some graduate education were assigned 17 years, and those with a graduate degree were assigned 18 years.\n"
